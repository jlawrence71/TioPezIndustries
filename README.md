# TITAN IIIe / Centaur - Voyager 1 & 2

# NOTE: see the 'eBrochure.pdf' document for an electropnic copy of the Build Book on display today.

This was built for the DARS (Dallas Area Rocket Society) Classic competition on Saturday September 27 2025  

Getting to know the launch platform that sent Voyager 1 & 2 on the 'Grand Tour' throughout our solar system and then beyond was about a month long experience.

Tools I used...

* AI assistance using ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude.  They helped with researching all the original dimensions (a must have for modelling something real) and understanding how the original rocket was configured.
* OpenSCAD - v2025_09_11 - Code based CAD program (the .scad files in this repo)
* Open Rocket - Simulate as close as possible the shape and weights to see if it is capable of flying. (It says it is, cross your fingers)
* Bambu Labs 3D printers - H2D, X1C - Filaments used: PC, PCTG, PLA
* Bambu Studio for slicing and printing.
