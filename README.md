# TITAN IIIe / Centaur - Voyager 1 & 2

This was built for the DARS (Dallas Area Rocket Society) Classic competition on Saturday September 27 2025  

Getting to know the launch platform that sent Voyager 1 & 2 on the 'Grand Tour' throughout our solar system and then beyond was about a month long experience.

Tools I used...

* AI assistance using ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude.  They helped with researching all the original dimensions (a must have for modelling something real) and understanding how the original rocket was configured.
